Brown Chris Farley
My girl look like Jackie O
Mr. Potential Abortion Stat
To that cat that pay his mommma mortgage cash is back
Rapping Nehru Jackets
Fashion fabrics front to back
In fact "What's poppin akh?"
In case I go bye-bye for poppin' Ox
Gave my mom thirty stacks cash for her safety deposit box
I ball 'til I'm y'all
With my last few breaths I will crawl to the mall
I go Darvin Ham
I'm Marvin Hamlisch
I swear my friends are trying to kill me
I'm online watching old interviews of Biggie
Keep my blinders on my
Eye on the prize my
Blind on the rise
Fly 'til demise
Like a bird in the sky
That dies as it glides
Mighty healthy salad over fries
Even styles p owns a juice bar
I'm trying to have long paper
Cause I was about my paper as a baby me
Sticking up all the kids stealing TI-83s
Tecate at the party
? They starve me promptly?
Loud pack
over Godfrey
Got the bomb weed
Sippin on Oban
Blowin' on some Marley
Cowabunga Gnarly
Brown Chris Farley
My girl look like Jackie O
More classy though
Young Placido
Domingo
tally ho
I be there like Ringo
My phone it rings though
And I'm like "Bingo!"
hit 'em with Dominican juno
Like baby Juno
My favorite writer is Junot Diaz
Hima smart as three SAT tests
No deep breaths he bests
No deep breaths he bests
Wait decease
Never good red
Wait good read
At a good speed
Blow some hood weed
