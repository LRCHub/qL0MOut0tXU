by the time you hear this
song it'll be over. narlie charlie's back again. he's
wearing a goatee. doesn't
look the way he did five
years before on the streets
again and knocking on my
door. only come out at night
when the lights are out and
no one's around. the streets
are his to take. it's uncle
charlie's first playground.
don't you know he will find you in your sleep and rip through
rip through you. why
don't you leave me alone. why
don't you stay away from me.
he doesn't value time on the
outside. hes' just looking in
on top of the world. today
see charlie's coming back
again. i can see why he
doesn't make it in the world
us who really care. why don't you leave me alone why don't
you stay away from me .
charlie's back again.
